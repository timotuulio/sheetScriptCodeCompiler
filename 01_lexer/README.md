In addition to the lexer code, the you submit a text document in either plain text (.txt), markdown (.md) or pdf (.pdf) format. It should contain answers to the following questions (again, in your own words, no copying from other sources):

    What is lexical analysis and how is it related to other parts in compilation?
    How is the lexical structure of the language expressed in the PLY tool? I.e., what parts are needed in the code and how are they related to lexical rules of the language?
    Explain how the following are recognized and handled in your code:
        Keywords
        Comments
        Whitespace between tokens
        Operators & delimiters (<-, parenthesis, etc.)
        Desimal literals
        String literals
        Function names
    How can the lexer distinguish between the following lexical elements:
        Function name identifiers & variable name identifiers
        Keywords & variable name identifiers
        Operators > (greater than) & >= (greator or equal)
        Info string literals & variables names
        Comments & other code
        Integer literals & a decimal literals
    Did you implement any extras? If so explain them (what and how)
    What did you think of this assignment? What was difficult? What was easy? Did you learn anything useful?
