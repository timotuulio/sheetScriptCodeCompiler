In addition to the code, the group submits a text document in either plain text (.txt), markdown (.md) or pdf (.pdf) format. It should document each semantic check / interpretation level youâ€™ve done, explaining how it works. If you implemented any things of your own, explain them also in the document. Also tell what you thought about this assignment? What was difficult? What was easy? Did you learn anything useful?
