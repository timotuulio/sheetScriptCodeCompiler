COMP.CS.400 Principles of Programming Languages
===============================================

This GIT repository is for the development of the course project.
Each of the submission phases have their own directory.

The purpose of this project is to implement a coding language Sheet script. The project is made by using Python as the base language and ply as a parsing tool. Different folders are for different parts of project but for the final and latest version, see folder 04_semantics_and_running (it includes all the necessary code from earlier parts making them redundant for people interested only in the final product of this project). There is another README there which explains how to run the project.
