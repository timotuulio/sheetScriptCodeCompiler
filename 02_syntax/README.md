    What is syntax analysis and how is it related to other parts in compilation?
    How is the syntactic structure of the language expressed in the PLY tool? I.e., what parts are needed in the code and how are they related to syntactic rules of the language?
    Explain in English what the syntax of the following elements mean (i.e. how would you describe the syntax in textual form):
        Sheet variable definition
        Function call
        Sheet variable definition with initialization list (“{…}”).
    Answer the following based on the syntax definition:
        Is it possible to define a “nested” function, i.e. to define a new function inside another function? Why?
        Is it syntactically possible to perform arithmetic with integers (1+2)? Why?
        Is it syntactically possible to initialize a range variable with a decimal value (range _rng = 2.0+3.0)? Why?
        Are the following allowed by the syntax: xx--yy and --xx? Why?
        Can comparisons appear in a sheet variable’s initialization list (sheet SS = { 1.0 < 2.0 })? Why?
        How is it ensured that addition/subtraction are done after multiplication/division?
        In SheetScript, statements and definitions are not separated by semicolons (like in Java/C++) or line breaks (like in Python). How does the syntax known when one thing ends and another begins?
    Please mention in the document if you didn’t implement functions (i.e. you are ok with passing with the minimum grade).
    What did you think of this assignment? What was difficult? What was easy? Did you learn anything useful?
